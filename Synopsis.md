# TREND ANALYSIS WITH PHONE DATA

This trend analysis project is worked on the route of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process which is one of the important step in Data Science process. I worked collaboratively as a part of 4-member team to complete this group project. We have used user.csv dataset that is taken from the Kaggle website to completely understand and implement the process of EDA on mobile data. This csv file contains all the attributes that are realted to mobile and app performance.

The source code of this project is performed by using Jupyter Notebook and Python kernel. 
EDA project main library requirements are:
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. seaborn
4. sklearn

From this project, we can analyse different metrics like number of apps installed, battery drain, app usage time by multiple age groups, user behaviour class and find how these effect the working of mobile devices and at last we can decipher which is the most preferred and high performancing mobile device model.
